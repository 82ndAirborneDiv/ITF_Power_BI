## Project Description:

This project is a repository housing R functions and scripts used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 Response International Task Force (ITF) COVID-19 Dashboard

As part of the CDC COVID-19 Response, the ITF Epi and Data Visualization Team has created and maintains an interal Power BI Dashboard to assist Task Force and response leadership with situational awareness of the global pandemic and response. The dashboard contains analyses of the most updated global case and testing data from multiple sources. The Power BI report that generates the dashboard runs multiple R scripts in order to refresh, process and update the data. The R functions in this project are used to read in case and testing data, apply algorithms and populate the underlying data tables of the report. Access to this dashboard is currently limited to CDC staff only.

The ITF plans to share several curated Power BI views of global case and testing data on the public CDC COVID Data Tracker (https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html#cases) to communicate to the general public the types of analyses CDC is conducting using international data. The code saved to this repository would be used to populate the data underlying those views in a Power BI Dashboard.
